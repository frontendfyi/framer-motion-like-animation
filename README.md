In this video we'll be creating an awesome animated button with Framer Motion. A button similar to for example Twitter's like animation. Where our button in this case shoots out stars and animated the text when it's being clicked.

For this we'll be using Framer Motions new animation sequences. A tool that makes it really easy to create timeline within your animates, and thus make animations dependent on each other / happen at certain times.
