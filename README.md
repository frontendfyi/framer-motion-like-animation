In this video we'll be creating an awesome animated button with Framer Motion. A button similar to for example Twitter's like animation. In our case the button has a star sparkle effect animates the text letter by letter when it's being clicked.

For this we'll be using Framer Motions new and powerful animation sequences – a tool that makes it really easy to create timelines within your animations. These timelines then make it super easy to make animations dependent on each other / happen at certain times.
